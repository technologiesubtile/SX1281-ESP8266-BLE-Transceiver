Abstract

Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a communication protocol for low power applications that require longlasting operation in battery powered applications at low weight and size (typical: smartwatches, sensors, drones, cargo tracking). With baud rates betweeen 125 kbps and 2 Mbps it is located between large bandwidth (WiFi) short range, and low bandwidth long range (LoRa, GFSK), FLRC being in the middle. In the sensitivity performance, FLRC and LoRa are closer to the Shannon bound than the 3 others due to the use of spread spectrum techniques.
Another interesting aspect of GFSK based BLE protocol is the number of device classes or profiles and the option by definition of the standard to display data beyond the device name or SSID already in the advertisement mode (previous BT versions: discovery) in the preview, prior to the handshake and pairing. Therefore, BLE devices are able to display for example a reduced set of sensor data to the public in the preview, or transmit public messages prior to the pairing process involving cryptography.

Requirements

For research purposes (sensitivity performance, protocol immunity, Doppler or carrier frequency offset stability), we require a BLE transceiver that can communicate at the standard 1 Mbps and reduced baud rate of 125 kbps. BLE 4.2 radios are now widely available but often lacking the 125 kbps rate. The Semtech SX128x chip seems to offer it at low cost and ease of use e.g. compared to the Nordic Semiconductor modules that come with their own IDE or an Arduino core that lacks advanced functionality. Moreover, the SX128x module is a most versatile 2.4 GHZ transceiver that features, in addition to basic GFSK and GFSK based BLE, also the modes FLRC, 2.4 GHz LoRa and in the 1280 version also a ranging engine. While GFSK, FLRC and LoRa stacks are implemented in hardware, BLE 4.2 compatibility is implemented only up to the physical layer.
We preferred this module despite the absence of the stack since for the intended characterization, a partial stack implementation below handshake would readily enable the advertisement mode. A first approach of testing it with available libraries (Stuart Robinson, Sandeep Mistry, Radiohead McCaulny, RadioLib) was disappointing because either the communication could not be established at all in BLE (authors focusing on LoRa ?) and/or some parameters (sync word aka access address) were not accessible through the library.
In the end, the decision was to abandon available libraries and to write our own library based on the commands given by the manufacturer datasheet [https://semtech.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#E0000000JelG/a/2R000000HoCb/X1yTNr5aeVlmviwNhvHyX9a2wSTSla.JWmnEtvAAlRk], using only the standard SPI library to transfer machine code and register values over the port.

Hardware

The aim is a transceiver that can be controlled over serial USB from a computer, tablet or smartphone and combines a radio module and a microcontroller, also enabling to run autonomously and store own code and some data. Whereas a choice of boards (Lillygo, TTgo etc.) are available that combine an ESP32 with a SX1278 LoRa radio, the SX128x can up to now (mai 2022) not be purchased on a similar board (susceptible of changing rapidly...). In principle it would also be possible to control a SX128x over serial port solely by a usb to serial bridge since its novelty is the ability to pass commands either via SPI or RS232, but this would require software on the host computer in order to be used ergonomously and preclude running code on the board. Our choice is to build our own experimental platform while a commercially available solution is still unavailable. Since the ESP32 is oversized for basic control of the SX128x, we opt for a ESP8266 D1 mini module. A requirement for us is a 50 Ohm output for connecting external antennas and measurement gear, rather than a PCB inverted F antenna often seen on Bluetooth and WiFi modules. A SX1281 module in a can package by niceRF has a solder pad antenna output (neither IFA nor IPEX connectors).

PCBoard design

The PCBoard is a single layer double sided component design that holds the D1 mini and SX128x on opposite sides. Compared to the SX1278 433 MHz LoRa radio used in a previous project, there are two more connections, DIO1 shall be connected in case interrupts are mapped to an output and the Busy pin is also additional. These two pins are connected to the nearby SDA and SCL pins of the Wemos respectively, meaning the I2C port becomes unusable and we sacrify the option of connecting sensors to it. The antenna is a normal solder pad, not an IPEX connector. We route it with a cm of (approximative...) coplanar waveguide towards an external sma edge connector. 
The SX128x module is located between the solder pad rows of the D1 mini DIL package. PCBoard design has the minor drawback that lanes pass underneath some unused solder pads of the SX128x module that must be isolated, e.g. by putting some mica or insulating tape underneath the module. At large scale production, solder stop mask could do the job. An external voltage regulator revealed to be unnecessary because the radio draws less power and can be hooked to the LDO regulator even of the budget clones of the D1 mini.

The code

is programmed in Arduino IDE with the ESP8266 core. The code is commented and self explaining. The name of the functions are close to the ones used in the datasheet [https://semtech.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#E0000000JelG/a/2R000000HoCb/X1yTNr5aeVlmviwNhvHyX9a2wSTSla.JWmnEtvAAlRk]. Features are the ability to enter PDUs (protocol data unit) by entering a space separated list of hex values or by ascii, and to form packets by calculating a header which the hardware does not perform for BLE since the module only provides BLE compatibility at the hardware level. The same way, byte arrays for configuration registers can be entered. Configuration data and the output packet can be stored on EEPROM to be loaded at the next power up. If EEPROM is absent, the hardcoded defaults will be used instead. The serial interface uses the settings 9k6 8N1. At startup a help screen is displayed. It can be re-displayed by typing "help".


The help screen

![blehelpscreen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96028811/211929275-8f953076-6a45-44f4-82b1-80d7f84f1971.jpg)


A bit of Syntax for the basic usage

Let us assume that we want to generate the BLE advertisement package as described by the sample 2 of the document
https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/general/adv-and-scanning/bluetooth-adv-data-basics#example
It means we have a list of hex values from which we want to generate an advertisement packet. We first define the payload by typing

blepayload 0x02 0x01 0x06 0x11 0x07 0x07 0xb9 0xf9 0xd7 0x50 0xa4 0x20 0x89 0x77 0x40 0xcb 0xfd 0x2c 0xc1 0x80 0x48 0x09 0x08 0x42 0x47 0x4d 0x31 0x31 0x31 0x20 0x53

Next, to generate an advertisement package from that payload, we type

makebleadv

this adds a header depending on the different settings (outpdutype....outmd) but let's leave the defaults for now.

to transmit it over the air, type

sendoutpdutotal

Later on, if we want to transmit the packet periodically, we define an interval <> 0 by setting it e.g. to 5 seconds:

intvl 5000

and telling our board to do a transmission every time the interval is due, otherwise it would only receive and display the result every interval.

txflag 1

the loop does reception by default and interrogates the receive buffer also every interval.

Packet received:

Upon packet reception, it is displayed along with the length, PDUtype from the header, the present frequency, RSSI, and the checksum :

Measurement of the output power

For this test, the power was set to 5 dBm and the continuous transmission of a carrier was enabled by the command setcw. A connected power meter yields 3.4 dBm, the difference 1.6 dB is attributed approximately to the losses of the GSG output lane between radio and SMA connector, the connectors themselves and cable losses.

Range test over 600 meters

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96028811/211938253-6108d208-1a0e-4473-8ab0-88defedcc084.png)   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96028811/211938286-8af4d4f2-980a-4d48-a565-096076d9f98b.png)

A first field test was performed with the equipment of above photo, 2 dBi nominal rubber antenna on mobile unit and window mount patch antenna, version with 22 mm washers. The protocol was BLE 1 Mbps, f= 2410 Khz, p= 5 dBm.

The displayed RSSI of the last received packet at a distance of 600 m was -96 dBm. 

Comparison with the link budget:

P_r = P_t + G_t + G_r - PL - L_pol - L_conn =

5 dBm + 7.4 dB  -1.2 dB - 95.6 dB - 3 dB â€“ 2 dB =  -89.4 dBm

Received power P_r

P_t is the transmitter power = 5 dBm nominal, the powermeter displays 3.4 dBm so 1.6 is taken in account in the connection loss L_conn. Another 0.4 dB are added for the connectors on the receiver side, yielding 2 dB declared as connection loss L_conn.

G_t is the gain of the transmitting antenna 10.4 dB according to our antenna study and we subtract 3 dB because the antenna is behind a double glass window, and we obtain 7.4 dB

G_r is the gain of the receive antenna which is -1.2 dB according to our antenna study.

For the antenna study, see:
https://github.com/technologiesubtile/2.4-GHz-ISM-antennas

Path loss: PL = 20 log (4 pi d f / c) = -95.6 dB

Polarization loss: L_pol: -3 dB between circular and linear, -20 dB between V and H

L_conn see above P_t

The 6.6 dB disagreement between RSSI and link budget can tentatively be attributed as follows:
- -96 dBm is better than on the datasheet p. 25 that states a sensitivity of -94 dBm for high sensitivity mode at FSK at 1 Mbps. The RSSI reading is not accurate.
- the polarization loss of 3 dB is between ideally circular and linear and can be more
- the propagation is through clear line of sight. However, it is close to the ground and there are obstacles along the way, both leading to multipath fading. In air and space communication, this effect will not occur.



Extrapolation and perspective 

The 600 meters range test was performed with artificially throttled performance. We can increase output power to 13 dBm, replace the antennas by 14 dBi quad patch on both sides, eliminating also the polarization loss, and we can communicate from ground to air/space to eliminate the multipath fading. Making use of all effects will increase the range to several (approaching 10) kilometers.



More syntax for the Expert mode

In general, all settings appearing in the help screen under the category â€œRadio related settingsâ€œ must be followed by the command â€œsetupbleâ€œ in order to be applied to the SX1281 and not only to the variables of the ESP8266. For example, to change the packet type to GFSK, we would use the commands

packettype 0x00
setupble

However for changing only the frequency, it is also possible to type

freq 2402.0
setrffreq

The setrffreq command, similarly as setupble, commits the modified frequency only to the transceiver, but it avoids committing all other radio settings. Similarly, for the power, it can be set e.g. to 10 dBm by

power 10
setrftxparams

or by

txparams 0x1c 0x80
setrftxparams

Warning: if the frequency is changed only by â€œfreq 2402.0â€œ and the committing by â€œsetrffreqâ€œ or â€œsetupbleâ€œ is omitted, the change does not become effective in the transceiver. However, for incoming packets, the resulting message would nevertheless wrongly indicate that the packet was received at 2402.0 MHz, although the transceiver would still be receiveing at the previous frequency.

Writing raw lists of Hex Bytes directly to the transceiver via the SPI port: in the basic usage, the command blepayload writes payload into a variable, the command makebleadv appends an advertisement header in front and stores everything in another variable, and finally the command sendoutpdutotal appends another 2 Hex bytes in front to specify that it is a write command and the memory location before sending everything to the transceiver. In some cases, the expert user (fluent in machine code) might want to send raw Hex Bytes or machine code to the transceiver instead. This is achieved by 

spiupload 0x12 0x34 0x56
spitransfer

During such operation, make sure that the interval for periodic Tx/Rx execution is set to 0
intvl 0

because otherwise the ESP8266 is periodically communicating with the transceiver and this would overwrite the spiupload buffer.





Details about the serial port

The communication settings are quite standard, 9.6 kbps, 8N1. The USB UART bridge of the Wemos D1 mini board is typically a CH341 in the case of the chinese clones but they are also available with a FTDI232 upon request. The expected termination is a newline \n character. However, since some terminal software, in particular Android apps, sometimes have difficulties in issuing a \n, there is also a 2 second timeout after which serial input is considered as terminated. As long as the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE is used, this is meaningless because the command is first typed into a line and then all characters are sent at once when pressing â€œenterâ€œ, together with the terminator choosen by the checkmark at the lower board of the window. However, when using terminal software that sends the characters one by one as they are typed, they must be typed quickly enough to prevent automatic termination by the timeout. An alternative is to paste the commands into the terminal program. For example in PuTTy, paste is done by Shift-Ins, and a newline can optionally be sent by Ctrl-J.
